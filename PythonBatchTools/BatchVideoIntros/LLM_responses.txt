To make all animations play automatically without requiring clicks, you need to ensure that the trigger for each animation is set to occur "After Previous" (i.e., immediately after the preceding animation finishes) rather than "On Click." Additionally, you should set the slide transition to advance automatically after the animations complete.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your `apply_animations` function:

```python
import win32com.client

def apply_animations(slide, shapes, animation_settings):
    try:
        sequence = slide.TimeLine.MainSequence
        
        effect_type = 10  # Fade-in effect
        delay = animation_settings.get('delay', 0.5)

        for i, shape in enumerate(shapes):
            # Add fade-in effect to each shape
            effect = sequence.AddEffect(shape, effect_type, win32com.client.constants.msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious)
            effect.Timing.Duration = 0.5  # Duration of fade-in effect

            # Set delay for each subsequent shape
            if i > 0:
                effect.Timing.TriggerDelayTime = delay

        # Set slide transition to advance automatically after a specified time
        slide.SlideShowTransition.AdvanceOnTime = True
        slide.SlideShowTransition.AdvanceTime = 1 + (len(shapes) * (delay + 0.5))  # Transition time = delay + effect duration per shape
        slide.SlideShowTransition.Duration = 1  # Transition duration

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error applying animations: {str(e)}")

# Example usage
ppt_app = win32com.client.Dispatch("PowerPoint.Application")
ppt_app.Visible = True
presentation = ppt_app.Presentations.Add()
slide = presentation.Slides.Add(1, win32com.client.constants.ppLayoutTitle)
shapes = [
    slide.Shapes.AddShape(win32com.client.constants.msoShapeRectangle, 100, 100, 200, 100),
    slide.Shapes.AddShape(win32com.client.constants.msoShapeOval, 350, 100, 200, 100),
]
animation_settings = {'delay': 0.5}
apply_animations(slide, shapes, animation_settings)
```

### Key Modifications:
1. **Trigger After Previous:** 
   - Set the animation trigger to `win32com.client.constants.msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious` to ensure each animation starts automatically after the previous one.
   
2. **Slide Transition Timing:**
   - The slide will automatically transition after a calculated time based on the number of shapes and the delay between animations.

3. **AdvanceOnTime:**
   - This property ensures that the slide transitions automatically after all animations have played, with no need for user interaction.

This should achieve your goal of having all shapes fade in sequentially and automatically, followed by an automatic slide transition.

To ensure that animations in your PowerPoint presentation play automatically without requiring user interaction, you need to set each animation to trigger after the previous one. Additionally, you should configure the slide transitions to advance automatically. Here's how you can modify your `apply_animations` function to achieve this:

### Modified `apply_animations` Function

```python
import win32com.client

def apply_animations(slide, shapes, animation_settings):
    try:
        sequence = slide.TimeLine.MainSequence
        
        effect_type = 10  # Fade-in effect
        delay = animation_settings.get('delay', 0.5)

        for i, shape in enumerate(shapes):
            # Add fade-in effect to each shape
            effect = sequence.AddEffect(
                shape,
                effect_type,
                trigger=win32com.client.constants.msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious
            )
            effect.Timing.Duration = 0.5  # Duration of fade-in effect
            
            # Set delay between animations
            if i > 0:
                effect.Timing.TriggerDelayTime = delay

        # Set slide transition to advance automatically
        slide.SlideShowTransition.AdvanceOnTime = True
        slide.SlideShowTransition.AdvanceTime = 1  # Time in seconds before advancing to next slide
        slide.SlideShowTransition.Duration = 1  # Duration of the transition effect

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error applying animations: {str(e)}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ppt_app = win32com.client.Dispatch("PowerPoint.Application")
    ppt_app.Visible = True

    presentation = ppt_app.Presentations.Add()
    slide = presentation.Slides.Add(1, win32com.client.constants.ppLayoutText)

    # Add shapes to slide for animation
    shape1 = slide.Shapes.AddShape(win32com.client.constants.msoShapeRectangle, 100, 100, 200, 100)
    shape2 = slide.Shapes.AddShape(win32com.client.constants.msoShapeRectangle, 100, 250, 200, 100)

    # Apply animations
    shapes = [shape1, shape2]
    animation_settings = {'delay': 0.5}
    apply_animations(slide, shapes, animation_settings)

    # Define output path and save
    output_path = r"C:\path\to\your\output\fade_in_test.pptx"
    presentation.SaveAs(output_path)
    print(f"Presentation saved to: {output_path}")

    # Close the presentation and quit the application
    presentation.Close()
    ppt_app.Quit()
```

### Key Changes

- **Trigger Type**: Set the `trigger` parameter to `msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious` for each effect to ensure that animations play automatically after the previous one finishes.
- **Slide Transition**: Configure `SlideShowTransition.AdvanceOnTime` to `True` and set `AdvanceTime` to the desired delay for automatically advancing to the next slide.
- **Transition Duration**: Set the `Duration` of the slide transition to control the length of the transition effect.

This setup will make each shape's fade-in animation play sequentially with a specified delay, and the slide will automatically transition to the next one after a set time. Adjust the `AdvanceTime` and `Duration` values to suit your presentation's timing requirements.
